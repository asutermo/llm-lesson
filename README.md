# LLM Lesson

I was asked to create a 20 minute lesson for Interview Kickstart while interviewing. This here is my lesson, and sample code. I was offered a position.

## Setup

I have provided a conda environment. You'll need to create a dev env file that contains the tokens (see [sample.env](./sample.env) for the tokens you'll need to run these).

```bash
conda create env -f environment.yml
```
